# BJSS grocery-store-challenge 

This is a project to demonstrate the use of a shopping cart with Angular 15+, thinking about usability, scalability, responsive with tested functions.

### Install npm packages and start the project

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` for backend and frontend and stats the project:

```shell
cd backend && npm install & cd .. && npm install
npm run start:all
```

Start the dev server by running the command above. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `start:all` - Config backend build and run the application and then run the frontend as well and make the complete application available on port `4200`.

These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs grocery-store-challenge tests.
